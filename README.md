# TechInterviewGuide
This is a definitive/general guide for technical interviews in most big companies


**Study material before applying/interviewing for jobs**

**[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)** should be your first study resource in prepping for coding interviews and solving easy problems that set you up for a solid foundation of solving problems. 
This book also provides in depth guides for certain big N / FAANG companies. This also includes a data structures crash course
for those that haven't had a data structures class or you just need some refreshers on data structures and their implementations.
The book has solutions for all problems as well as hints similar to what you would receive in technical interviews.


**[Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions)** 

is a list of 75 leetcode questions that one should do before being comfortable in almost any new grad technical interview.
You can also use blind 75 in order to start applying/interviewing for software engineering internships at big companies as well though most interviews will be easier than new grad interviews

**[neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice)**

This is a longer list of leetcode questions if you wish to have further practice after blind 75. The creater of neetcode 150 also has solutions for each question on youtube provided in each question on the website. 

**[TechInterview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/software-engineering-interview-guide/)** 

This is another resource that goes very in depth about technical interviews and what you should know in order to ace technical interviews.

If you want to look at salaries for almost every big company and know your worth for software engineering, check this site out. This is real and verified salaries from software engineers at all companies listed on the site.
The site requires pdfs of your offer letter verifying your salary for your respective level (IE new grad, swe 1, swe 2, senior swe, etc.). Each company has different levels but they are very similar. 

If you want anything else added to this repo, feel free to let me know or do a pull request. This is to help out new grad computer science majors and those not in their senior years looking for internships as well.
